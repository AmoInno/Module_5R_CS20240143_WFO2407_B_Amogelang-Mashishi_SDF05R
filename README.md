# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

This project focuses on creating three unique animated buttons using CSS.

## Project Overview

1. Button 1
I wanted to create a 3-D version on the button. When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click on it, it presses down.

2. Button 2
When you hover over it, it enlarges, changes gradient colors and comes forward. It created a beautiful holographic-like gradient 

3. Button 3
It has a gradient outline and when you click on it, it changes color.
